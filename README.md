# taggy demo
This is a small demo site to showcase taggy.

Please clone the main taggy repository first, to have the compiled JS-code ready under:
"../../taggy/lib/index" 

```
├── taggy                   # the taggy main repository
├── demo                    # this repository
```

Then install dependencies and start up:

```
npm install
npm run start
```
